### Acceptance Criteria
Due to us having to review submissions from multiple applicants and the potential for technologies that our team is not familiar with being used, submissions must have simple, well-documented instructions that clearly explain how to run the submitted project. This includes any services needed for the project to run and any environment variables that need to be set. Any questions about what needs to be included in a valid submission can be directed to [Lisa Couture](mailto:lcouture@edgewebware.com?cc=tmoore@edgewebware.com) for trafficking as needed.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be assessed based on the following criteria:
- Code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- Implementation of best practices and design patterns.
- Adequate test coverage.
- Documentation completeness and clarity.
- Adherence to coding conventions and standards.
